= Getting started with the Open Liberty application server

Learn how to deploy and update an application on Open Liberty with Maven and Docker.

== What you'll learn

You will learn how to run a simple REST microservice that exposes the JVM's system properties on an
Open Liberty server. You will use Maven to build and run this microservice, as well as to control
the Open Liberty server.

Open Liberty is an application server designed for the cloud. It's small, lightweight, and designed
with modern cloud-native application development in mind. It supports the full MicroProfile and Java
EE APIs and is composable, meaning that you can use only the features that you need, keeping the
server lightweight, which is great for microservices. It also deploys to every major developer platform,
including Docker, Kubernetes, and Cloud Foundry.

Maven is an automation build tool that provides an efficient way to develop applications for Open Liberty.
Using Maven, you will build a simple microservice that collects basic system properties from your
laptop and displays them on an endpoint that you can access in your web browser. You will then make
configuration and code changes and see how they are picked up by a running server. You'll also explore
how to package your the application with the server runtime so that it can be deployed anywhere in one go.

Finally, you will package the application along with the server configuration into a Docker image and
then run that image as a container.

// Prerequisites
// =================================================================================================

== Prerequisites

Before you begin, make sure that you have the following tools installed:

- `Maven` - a build automation tool. For installation instructions see https://maven.apache.org/install.html
- `Docker` - a containerization software. For installation instructions see https://docs.docker.com/install/


// =================================================================================================
// Getting Started
// =================================================================================================

include::{common-includes}/gitclone.adoc[]

// There's not really any value (in this particular guide) of including the 'try it first' section.
// The start version of the application works in much the same way as the finish version. It's the
// process of looking at how the server runs the app that's important here, rather than the application
// itself. I could be convinced otherwise though?


// =================================================================================================
// Building and running the application
// =================================================================================================

== Building and running the application

Your application is configured to be built using Maven. Every Maven-configured project contains a `pom.xml`
file, which defines the project configuration, dependencies, plugins, etc. To learn more about Maven,
check out our https://openliberty.io/guides/maven-intro.html[Maven guide].

Your `pom.xml` file has been configured to include the Liberty Maven plugin (`liberty-maven-plugin`),
which allows you to install applications into WebSphere Liberty and Open Liberty as well as manage
the server instances.

To begin, build the microservice we've provided and then run it in Open Liberty. To do this, navigate
into the `start` directory and run the following command:

```
mvn install liberty:run-server
```

The `mvn` command runs a Maven build, during which, the `target` directory is created to hold all
build-related files.

The `install` argument specifies the Maven `install` phase, during which the application is built and
packaged into a `.war` file, the Open Liberty server runtime is downloaded and installed to `target/liberty/wlp`,
an Open Liberty server is created and configured under `target/liberty/wlp/usr/servers/GettingStartedServer`,
the application is installed into that server via loose config.

The `liberty:run-server` argument specifies the `run-server` goal thats part of the `liberty-maven-plugin`.
This goal starts an Open Liberty server in the foreground.

For more information on the Liberty Maven plugin, visit our official https://github.com/WASdev/ci.maven[GitHub repository].

When the server starts, you should see the following message:

[source, role="no_copy"]
----
[INFO] [AUDIT] CWWKF0011I: The server GettingStartedServer is ready to run a smarter planet.
----

To access the microservice, visit the http://localhost:9080/system/properties URL. You should see a
list of your JVM's system properties:

[source, JSON, role="no_copy"]
----
{
    "java.vendor":"Oracle Corporation",
    "default.https.port":"9443",
    "sun.java.launcher":"SUN_STANDARD",
    ...
}
----

Later, when you need to stop the server, simply hit `CTRL+C` in the shell session where you ran the
server or run the `liberty:stop-server` goal from another shell session like so:

```
mvn liberty:stop-server
```

// =================================================================================================

== Updating the server configuration without restarting the Open Liberty server

When you update various server files, you can run the `mvn package` command to invoke the Maven `package`
phase, which executes various Maven goals that repackage the server. Note, that if the server is running
and your `pom.xml` file is configured to run the `liberty:package-server` goal during the `package`
phase, then the `liberty:package-server` goal will fail unless you specify a different output directory
for the archive.

Let's try updating the source code while the server is running. The `system` microservice does
not currently include health monitoring to report whether the server and the microservice that it runs
are healthy. Health reports can be easily added with the MicroProfile Health feature.

The server should still be running but, if you've stopped it, start it again by running the
`mvn liberty:run-server` command. Next, try to access the health endpoint from a browser by visiting
the http://localhost:9080/health/ URL. As expected, you see a 404 error since the health endpoint
does not yet exist:

[source, role="no_copy"]
----
Error 404: java.io.FileNotFoundException: SRVE0190E: File not found: /health
----

To add the MicroProfile Health feature to the server, add the `mpHealth-1.0` feature to the
`src/main/liberty/config/server.xml` server configuration file:

[source, xml, indent=0]
----
include::finish/src/main/liberty/config/server.xml[tag=features]
----

Next, while the server is still running, open a new shell session and repackage the server with the
`mvn package` command.

When enabled, the `mpHealth-1.0` feature adds a `/health` endpoint to the application automatically.
You can see the server being updated in the server log thats being displayed in your first shell session:

[source, role="no_copy"]
----
[INFO] [AUDIT] CWWKG0016I: Starting server configuration update.
[INFO] [AUDIT] CWWKT0017I: Web application removed (default_host): http://foo:9080/
[INFO] [AUDIT] CWWKZ0009I: The application io.openliberty.guides.getting-started has stopped successfully.
[INFO] [AUDIT] CWWKG0017I: The server configuration was successfully updated in 0.284 seconds.
[INFO] [AUDIT] CWWKT0016I: Web application available (default_host): http://foo:9080/health/
[INFO] [AUDIT] CWWKF0012I: The server installed the following features: [mpHealth-1.0].
[INFO] [AUDIT] CWWKF0008I: Feature update completed in 0.285 seconds.

[INFO] [AUDIT] CWWKZ0003I: The application io.openliberty.guides.getting-started updated in 0.173 seconds.
----

Try to access the `/health` endpoint again by visiting the http://localhost:9080/health URL, this time
you should see the following JSON:

[source, JSON, role="no_copy"]
----
{
    "checks":[],
    "outcome":"UP"
}
----

// =================================================================================================

== Updating the source code without restarting the Open Liberty server

Your Java application is configured as a `loose application`, meaning that it runs in a server from
its `.class` file and other artifacts. Open Liberty automatically monitors these artifacts and whenever
they are updated, the server updates the running application without needing to be restarted. This is
convenient because you don't need to repeatedly stop and start the server whenever you make code changes.
If your IDE is configured to recompile each time you save your changes, you don't even need to recompile
yourself through Maven.

Take a look at the `pom.xml` file for the sample application. The loose application support is enabled
using the `<looseApplication>` setting under the `liberty-maven-plugin`.

At the moment, the `/health` endpoint reports that the server is running but it doesn't provide any
details of the microservice that runs inside the server. To report on the health status of the microservice,
create a new file `src/main/java/io/openliberty/sample/system/SystemHealth.java`:

[source, java]
----
include::finish/src/main/java/io/openliberty/sample/system/SystemHealth.java[tags=**;!copyright]
----

Next, run recompile the application by running the following command:

```
mvn compile
```

You should see the following messages appear in the server log:

[source, role="no_copy"]
----
[INFO] [AUDIT] CWWKT0017I: Web application removed (default_host): http://foo:9080/
[INFO] [AUDIT] CWWKZ0009I: The application io.openliberty.guides.getting-started has stopped successfully.
[INFO] [AUDIT] CWWKT0016I: Web application available (default_host): http://foo:9080/
[INFO] [AUDIT] CWWKZ0003I: The application io.openliberty.guides.getting-started updated in 0.136 seconds.
----

Try to access the `/health` endpoint again by visiting the http://localhost:9080/health URL, this time
you should see the overall status of your server and the microservice that it runs:


[source, JSON, role="no_copy"]
----
{
    "checks":[
        {
            "data":
            {
                "services": "available"
            },
            "name": "SystemResource",
            "state": "UP"
        }
    ],
    "outcome": "UP"
}
----

As you can see, making code changes and recompiling is straightforward as the application does not
need to be rebuilt entirely, and the server doesn't need to be restarted to pickup the new changes.


// =================================================================================================
// Checking the Open Liberty server logs
// =================================================================================================

== Checking the Open Liberty server logs

While the server is running in the foreground, it displays various console messages, which are also
logged to the `target/liberty/wlp/usr/servers/defaultServer/logs/console.log` file. You can find the
complete server log under the `target/liberty/wlp/usr/servers/defaultServer/logs` directory. The primary
log files in that directory are `console.log` and `messages.log` which contain console output of the
running application and server. Additional logs are created when more serious errors occur or whenever
tracing is enabled. These can be found under the `ffdc` directory and in the `trace.log` file respectively.

To enable logging of specific Java packages or classes, add the `logging` element to the `server.xml`
file in the following form:

```
<logging traceSpecification="<component_1>=<level>:<component_2>=<level>:..."/>
```

Where the `component` is a Java package or class and the `level` is one of the following logging levels:
off, fatal, severe, warning, audit, info, config, detail, fine, finer, finest, all.

For example, to enable detailed logging of the `mpHealth` feature you added earlier, use the following
element:

```
<logging traceSpecificatio="com.ibm.ws.microprofile.health.*=all"/>
```

When you visit the `/health` endpoint, additional traces will be logged into the `trace.log` file.

// =================================================================================================

== Starting and stopping the Open Liberty server in the background

In the previous sections, you started and stopped the server in the foreground by using the Maven
`liberty:run-server` goal. Alternatively, you can also start and stop the server in the background
using the Maven `liberty:start-server` and `liberty:stop-server` goals:

[source, role="no_copy"]
----
mvn liberty:start-server
mvn liberty:stop-server
----

// =================================================================================================

== Running the application from a minimal runnable JAR

So far, Open Liberty has been running out of the `target/liberty/wlp` directory, which effectively
contains a installed Open Liberty server installation and the deployed application. The final product
of the Maven build is a `server package` for use in a Continuous Integration (CI) pipeline and, ultimately,
a production deployment.

Open Liberty supports a number of different server packages. The sample application currently generates
a `usr` package that only contains the servers and application to be extracted on to an Open Liberty
installation. The type of server package is configured in your `pom.xml` in the following two lines:

[source, xml, indent=0, role="no_copy"]
----
<packaging.type>usr</packaging.type>
<include>${packaging.type}</include>
----

You can, alternatively, package the server with a full installation of Open Liberty in a runnable JAR file.
To do this, run the following command:

```
mvn install -P runnable-package
```

The `-P` flag specifies a profile to be run during the build. In this case, the `runnable-package`
profile is invoked, which temporarily overrides the `packaging.type` Maven property from `usr` to
`runnable`:

[source,xml,indent=0, role="no_copy"]
----
include::finish/pom.xml[tags=profile-runnable-package]
----

When the build completes, you can find the runnable `GettingStarted.jar` file under the `target`
directory. By default, this JAR comes with all the features available in Open Liberty, which include
the entirety of Java EE 7 and MicroProfile 1.3. As a result, this JAR comes out to be about 93 MB in
size. To omit the features that you don't need and package the JAR only with the features that you
defined in the `server.xml` file, specify the packaging type to be `minifiy,runnable`. We've already
configured the `minify-runnable-package` profile to do this for you. Invoke the profile as you did
earlier by using the `-P` flag:

```
mvn install -P minify-runnable-package
```

The `minify-runnable-package` overrides the `package.type` property from `usr` to `minify,runnable`
to generate a runnable JAR file that only contains the features you've explicitly enabled in your `server.xml`
file. As a result, the generated JAR is only about 39 MB in size.

To run the JAR, first stop the server if its running, then navigate to the `target` directory and run
the following command:

```
java -jar GettingStarted.jar
```

Once the server starts, visit the http://localhost:9080/system/properties URL to access the application
that is now running from the minimal runnable JAR.


// =================================================================================================
// Running the application in a Docker container
// =================================================================================================

== Running the application in a Docker container

To containerize the application, you need a `Dockerfile`, which contains a collection of instructions
that define how a Docker image is built, what files are packaged into it, whats executed when the
image runs as a container, etc. We are providing you with a complete `Dockerfile` under the `start`
directory, which builds an image that contains an Open Liberty runtime and the `usr` server package
generated by Maven.

Like with building runnable JARs, we've configured another profile to build the Docker image for you.
The `docker-image` profile uses the `dockerfile-maven` plugin, which automatically builds a Docker
image from a `Dockerfile` located in the same directory as the `pom.xml` file:

[source, XML, role="no_copy", indent=0]
----
include::finish/pom.xml[tags=profile-docker-image]
----

To build and containerize the application, invoke the profile as before by using the `-P` flag:

```
mvn clean package -P docker-image
```

During the Maven `package` phase, a `usr` server package is generated into the `target` directory.
The Docker `openliberty-getting-started:1.0-SNAPSHOT` image is also built that contains this server
package. Verify that this image has been built by running the following command to list all local
Docker image:

```
docker images
```

To run the image as a container, run the following command:

```
docker run -d --name gettingstarted-app -p 9080:9080 -p 9443:9443 openliberty-getting-started:1.0-SNAPSHOT
```

This is quite a long command, so let's break it down:

[cols="15, 100", options="header"]
|===
| *Flag* | *Description*
| -d     | Runs the container in the background.
| --name | Specifies a name for the container.
| -p     | Maps the container's ports to the host's.
|===

The final argument to the `docker run` command is the Docker image name.

Next, run the following command to verify that your container has started:

```
docker ps
```

You should see the following output (truncated for readability):

[source, role="no_copy"]
----
CONTAINER ID    IMAGE                         CREATED          STATUS           NAMES
4294a6bdf41b    openliberty-getting-started   9 seconds ago    Up 11 seconds    gettingstarted-app
----

To access the application visit the http://localhost:9080/system/properties URL.

To stop and remove the container, run the following commands:

```
docker stop gettingstarted-app && docker rm gettingstarted-app
```

To remove the image, run the following command:

```
docker rmi openliberty-getting-started:1.0-SNAPSHOT
```
